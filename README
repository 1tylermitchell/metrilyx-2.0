### Requirements
Metrilyx will run on any system that supports the packages below.  It has primarily been tested on RedHat based flavors of Linux.

##### OS Packages:
	libuuid
	uuid
	httpd
	mod_wsgi
	

##### Python Packages:
	Django
	django-filter
	Markdown
	djangorestframework
	uuid

### Installation
The provided makefile will work with **RedHat** based distributions.  You can issue the command below, which will auto-install the complete package including dependencies:	
	
	[</path/to/app>]$ make
	

This will install all required OS packages as well as python packages and restart apache.

For **other distributions**, follow the instructions below:

	- Install the required OS packages based on your OS distributions package manager.
	
	- [</path/to/app>]$ make pydeps
	
	- [</path/to/app>]$ make install
	

### Configuration

###### Path 
%{metrilyx_home}/etc/metrilyx.conf

The configuration file is essentially a python file. The path is a hard link to %{metrilyx_home}/metrilyx/metrilyxconfig.py and is meant for user convenience.
	
	config = {
		"tsdb": {
			"uri":"tsdb.example.com",
			"port": 80
		},
		"static_path": os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "static"),
		"schema_path": os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)), "schemas"),
		"model_path": os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)), "pagemodels")
	}
	
###### tsdb.uri
OpenTSDB http host

###### tsdb.port
OpenTSDB http Port (default: 80)

###### static_path (should not be changed)
Path to webroot static content.  

*** Changing this value would require changing other configuration items as well.
		
###### schema_path (should not be changed)
Path to pod, graph, page schemas.

###### model_path (default: %{home}/pagemodels)
Path to directory where JSON page models (i.e. dashboards) will be stored.
